    Welcome to Walden Pond. There's a bunch of things to explore in the menu, up
    there ‚Üó.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there isn't much in your Pocket yet, take a look in your emails for some
    places that might have something you'll want to read and some tips on how to
    make saving things easier. Our emails often go to spam, so if you add
    ben@notionparallax.co.uk to your address book, then they should stay
    visible. Alternitevely, search your spam for <em>Walden Pond</em> and mark
    it as legit there.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'd love to hear about how this is all going for you! Give
    <a
      href="(mailto:ben@notionparallax.co.uk?cc=user@email.com&subject=I had an idea!&body=What about more unicorns?"
      >me</a
    >
    suggestions and I'll do my best to make them happen.
