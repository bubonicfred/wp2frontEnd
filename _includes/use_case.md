- ![](./img/ben.jpg) I take mine to a cafe, and leave my phone at home. If I take the phone it takes two hours to read, without the phone it takes an hour. If I try reading long articles on the Pocket app, I don't know how long it would take, I always get distracted! <span class="testimonial-name">[Ben, developer](https://twitter.com/notionparallax).</span>
- ![](./img/julz.jpg) I read on a screen all day for work, so taking time to read on a physical zine custom curated by me makes my leisure reading really enjoyable. Great quality printing and integrates really well with my pocket. <span class="testimonial-name">JÃ¼lz, engineer.</span>

Now I get a surprise pick of articles I've saved to pocket. It comes in a perfectly sized paper format - which is just right for squeezing in a bit of reading whenever and wherever I have time. <span class="testimonial-name">[Ronie, PhD student](https://twitter.com/RonieWalters).</span>

For me, it straddles a difficult dichotomy between wanting to disconnect from digital media and desiring to stay in touch, connected and up to date. I find reading on paper helps me to assimilate information better and being able to annotate helps formulate my ideas. Oh and it's beautiful, too! <span class="testimonial-name">[Heather, teacher](https://twitter.com/he4therlouise).</span>
- ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/970835043554856960/6lr_2cbH_400x400.jpg) I'm about to get my third curated edition of Walden Pond and I'm really looking forward to receiving it. Reading online articles in a physical book has been wonderfully relaxing, especially over a cup of coffee or breakfast in the morning. This service has not only helped me to reduce my screen time, it's been a welcome reminder that there are articles, ideas, and stories "past me" wanted to read, but didn't have time to do so. Now I can incorporate my reading into self-care time and really enjoy exploring topics that piqued my interest and keep me inspired. <span class="testimonial-name">[Angela, Learning Designer](https://twitter.com/angelajgreco).</span>
