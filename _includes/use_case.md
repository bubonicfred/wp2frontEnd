## What people think

- ![](./img/Jenn.jpg) When I cracked open my first edition I felt like it had been grown in a lab just for me. The perfect digital detox. <span class="testimonial-name">[Jenn, librarian](https://twitter.com/wateryone).</span>
- ![](./img/ben.jpg) I take mine to a cafe, and leave my phone at home. If I take the phone it takes two hours to read, without the phone it takes an hour. If I try reading long articles on the Pocket app, I don't know how long it would take, I always get distracted! <span class="testimonial-name">[Ben, developer](https://twitter.com/notionparallax).</span>
- ![](./img/julz.jpg) I read on a screen all day for work, so taking time to read on a physical zine custom curated by me makes my leisure reading really enjoyable. Great quality printing and integrates really well with my pocket. <span class="testimonial-name">JÃ¼lz, engineer.</span>

Now I get a surprise pick of articles I've saved to pocket. It comes in a perfectly sized paper format - which is just right for squeezing in a bit of reading whenever and wherever I have time. <span class="testimonial-name">[Ronie, PhD student](https://twitter.com/RonieWalters).</span>

For me, it straddles a difficult dichotomy between wanting to disconnect from digital media and desiring to stay in touch, connected and up to date. I find reading on paper helps me to assimilate information better and being able to annotate helps formulate my ideas. Oh and it's beautiful, too! <span class="testimonial-name">[Heather, teacher](https://twitter.com/he4therlouise).</span>
