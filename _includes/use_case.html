      When I cracked open my first edition I felt like it had been grown in a
      lab just for me. The perfect digital detox.

      I'm about to get my third curated edition of Walden Pond and I'm really
      looking forward to receiving it. Reading online articles in a physical
      book has been wonderfully relaxing, especially over a cup of coffee or
      breakfast in the morning. This service has not only helped me to reduce my
      screen time, it's been a welcome reminder that there are articles, ideas,
      and stories "past me" wanted to read, but didn't have time to do so. Now I
      can incorporate my reading into self-care time and really enjoy exploring
      topics that piqued my interest and keep me inspired.

      I read on a screen all day for work, so taking time to read on a physical
      zine custom curated by me makes my leisure reading really enjoyable. Great
      quality printing and integrates really well with my pocket.

      With Walden Pond, I no longer need to email articles to myself to (never)
      read later. Now I get a surprise pick of articles I've saved to pocket. It
      comes in a perfectly sized paper format - which is just right for
      squeezing in a bit of reading whenever and wherever I have time.

      Walden Pond is one of those genius ideas because it is so simple - why
      hasn't anyone thought of this before? For me, it straddles a difficult
      dichotomy between wanting to disconnect from digital media and desiring to
      stay in touch, connected and up to date. I find reading on paper helps me
      to assimilate information better and being able to annotate helps
      formulate my ideas. Oh and it's beautiful, too!

      I take mine to a cafe, and leave my phone at home. If I take the phone it
      takes two hours to read, without the phone it takes an hour. If I try
      reading long articles on the Pocket app, I don't know how long it would
      take, I always get distracted!

      Walden Pond removes all distractions and relieves my FOMO by delivering
      exactly what I want to read... when I'll actually read it. I'm obsessed.
