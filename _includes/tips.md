- If you want a particular article to be in the upcoming edition, then tag it with <code>wpMustPrint</code>. If you don't want something to be printed, then tag it with <code>wpNoPrint</code>.

  Once you've tagged something with each of those tags, Pocket will remember them so it's easy to tag articles with them in future.


- Articles with `computer code` can be hard to print because the lines are sometimes really long, you can't exclude them yet but we're working on it.

- Wikipedia articles are sometimes a bit of a challenge because they have can have huge tables and so many links to other parts of the page.

- If your edition takes about an hour to read. Each article has a reading time that's estimated by Pocket's algorithms. If you have your longest article set to 50 minutes, and your shortest set to 45, there's no way to make an hour of content so you'll only get one article. You can solve this by making sure that your shortest is less than _(1 hour &minus; longest)_ so that it can fill the gap.

- There's something special about writing on your articles. I enjoy reading Walden Pond much more with a pen in my hand.

- You need to keep more content in your Pocket than you want in your edition so that there's enough to pick from. If you get the mobile app and the browser extension for Pocket that makes it much easier because you can save without thinking too much.

- If you liked an article, you can go to your [history](history) page and click on the link. That'll take you to the article in Pocket where you can recommend it to friends, or just mark it as _read_ which will make sure that it doesn't ever show up in your _Walden Pond_ again.
