        In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his groundbreaking book, The
        Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, which
        described his three laws of motion. In the process, Newton laid the
        foundation for classical mechanics and redefined the way the world
        looked at physics and science.

        IT’S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to
        great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the
        wrong person. Partly, it’s because we have a bewildering array of
        problems that emerge when we try to get close to others.

        All physical structures can sag, but only sentient beings like you and
        me can slouch. To slouch is to adopt a degenerate behavioral posture.

        takes it out of play.

        pit bulls, a Chihuahua, and a Yorkshire terrier—named Junior, Taco,
