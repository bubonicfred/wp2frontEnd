## What's changed?

### May

#### In the zine:

- Because there's a new printer:
  - the booklets are now 6&times;9 inches, and not A5. You probably wouldn't notice the difference if they weren't side by side.
  - There's a new binding style, perfect bound, not saddle stitch (which is a printing euphemism for "stapled").
  - editions can be much longer now. I've got a 10 hour edition on order as a test!
- Started using Mako templates. You won't see any difference, but it makes for much cleaner markup, which leads to fewer bugs.
- Link markers, the superscript numbers<sup>1</sup> that tell you what the URL for the link is, don't break away from their word any more. Sometimes you'd get the link on the next line which was waaay confusing.
- New curation algorithm. I was using a home baked algo, but now I'm using the [Google OR Tools Knapsack solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/bin/knapsack) which will allow for all kinds of fun things in the future.
- Plus the standard, obsessive, layout tweaking that I do instead of sleeping or eating.

#### On the website:

- [There's a new editorial feature that let you control the subjects of your editions](https://twitter.com/WaldenPondZine/status/1264813627069984768).
- The payment page now allows you to change your subscription type. If you want a 4 hour book one month, then a 1 hour PDF the next, that's cool, you can manage that now.
- A bunch of little fixes to make it a bit nicer to use.

### April

#### In the zine:

- There are lots of little typography upgrades. Em dashes&mdash;my
  favourite&mdash;are now rendered much more neatly. Same goes for fractions,
  e.g. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> and en dashes, e.g. 1<span class="wp-ndash">&ndash;</span>13
- The mysterious numbers underneath images in New Yorker articles have gone.
- Articles that have more than one author are now properly attributed.
- A bunch of tiny changes that should add up to having a more enjoyable read.

#### On the website:

- The sign up flow has changed a little. It's still a bit crusty, but much less so than before.
- There is a graph on the <em>Editorial details</em> page. This means that you don't need me to check if your filters leave you with enough content.
- There is a <em>Tips</em> page that has a bunch of suggestions that might mean that you get more out of Walden Pond.
- You can now pick your paper colour on the <em>Editorial details</em> page.
