## What's changed?

In the zine:

- There are lots of little typography upgrades. Em dashes&mdash;my
  favourite&mdash;are now rendered much more neatly. Same goes for fractions,
  e.g. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> and en dashes, e.g. 1<span class="wp-ndash">&ndash;</span>13
- The mysterious numbers underneath images in New Yorker articles have gone.
- Articles that have more than one author are now properly attributed.
- A bunch of tiny changes that should add up to having a more enjoyable read.

On the website:

- The sign up flow has changed a little. It's still a bit crusty, but much less so than before.
- There is a graph on the <em>Editorial details</em> page. This means that you don't need me to check if your filters leave you with enough content.
- There is a <em>Tips</em> page that has a bunch of suggestions that might mean that you get more out of Walden Pond.
- You can now pick your paper colour on the <em>Editorial details</em> page.
