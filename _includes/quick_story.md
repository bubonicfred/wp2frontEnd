## The quick story

There's a lot of good content online, but I can't martial my attention
to engage with it properly. My limit is about 4 minutes before a
notification breaks my focus, or I get sucked into checking my phone.
Maybe you're a bit like me? The idea here is that you can just save
articles to Pocket, and then once a month you'll get a little
magazine with an hour of reading.
