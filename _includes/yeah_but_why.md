## Why is it called "Walden Pond"?

Some of the more loony self-help gurus preach an all-or-nothing doctrine that's not particularly helpful if you live in the real world. (Whatever that actually means.)

[Henry Thoreau][thoreau] wrote [Walden][walden] while shacked up in a cabin by [Walden Pond (the lake)][map]. He was making a show of being far from the madding crowd, but was only 2 miles away from town, and would get his mum to do his laundry. This isn't taking a swipe at Thoreau for being disingenuous, I think it was smart. He was managing his attention, not living in a state of nature, and not living in a state of perpetual hyperstimulation.

_Walden Pond_ the zine is named after the technique, not the place. (see: [Against Waldenponding](https://mailchi.mp/ribbonfarm/against-waldenponding).)
