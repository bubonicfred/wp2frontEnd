## Editorial

Each edition I'd like to read <a href="/editorial"><span class="minutes_of_content_wanted" title="This is locked at 60 for the moment, but we might change that in the future.">X</span></a> minutes of articles I already know I want to read.

I'd like the articles to be between <a href="/editorial"><span class="shortest_article">X</span> and <span class="longest_article">Y</span></a> minutes long.

I <a href="/editorial"><span class="allow_code">don't</span> want</a> articles with computer code in them.
