## The long story

In 2018 [Vankatesh Rao](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/author/admin/) wrote a piece in his newsletter, "[Against Waldenponding](https://mailchi.mp/ribbonfarm/against-waldenponding)". He writes "There is valuable info at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay plugged in. You can manage anxiety and beat the House without resorting to shaming social platforms into managing attention for you." Which is exactly what Walden Pond is for; it lets you manage your attention yourself. It keeps you plugged into the "Giant Social Computer in the Cloud" but in a way that allows you to manage the flow of disruptions across your brain-cloud barrier.

It's fashionable (and obvious in hindsight) to work out what part of the day you work in what ways, and to do the work that fits that work style best. Richard Hamming scheduled "[Great Thoughts Time](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)" on Friday afternoons. Lots of people try to avoid meetings in the mornings. Whatever _you_ need to do to manage your connection to the world is the right thing to do, as long as it optimises for what you want out of life.

In _[Deep work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27985224-deep-work)_ Cal Newport suggests that you should <q>attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.</q>, which is pretty hard to do if you're getting group WhatsApp messages about nothing in particular. Even the buzz of the phone causes a burning FOMO that eventually forces me to look at it and break my attention.
