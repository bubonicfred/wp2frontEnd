## What is ![](https://assets.getpocket.com/web/main/Components/Logo/pocket_logo.fe803ab33bfe0272aea33040711caf9e.svg) ?

[Pocket is a service](https://getpocket.com/) that lets you save articles to read later. I've been using it for about 10 years now. It's free for a normal account, which covers almost everything you need. It's run by Mozilla, the Firefox people, so you know they are serious about privacy.

You need a Pocket account to use Walden Pond. At the risk of stating the obvious, you also need to save at least an hour's worth of reading too. (Or however long your edition is going to be!)

[I wrote about how I use Pocket to keep me sane](https://notionparallax.co.uk/2014/offline-reading). It's bit old now, but most of it still applies (not the bit about Google+, obvs!).
