## Tips

<figure>
<img src="./img/android_tag_at_save.png">
<figcaption>You can tag from inside the Pocket app or, at least in Android, you can do it as you save it.

If you especially want a particular article to be in the upcoming edition,
then tag it with <code>wpMustPrint</code>. If you don't want something to be
printed, then tag it with <code>wpNoPrint</code>.

Articles with computer code can be hard to read because the lines are
sometimes really long, you can't exclude them yet but we're working on it.

Wikipedia articles are sometimes a bit of a challenge too because they have
can have huge tables and so many links to other parts of the page.

# debug data

Don't worry about this, it's so that I can see everything, but it's here in case
you're interested in what data we've captured about you.

## Editorial

Each edition I'd like to read <a href="/editorial"><span class="minutes_of_content_wanted">X</span></a> minutes of articles I already know I want to read.

I'd like the articles to be between <a href="/editorial"><span class="shortest_article">X</span> and <span class="longest_article">Y</span></a> minutes long.

I <a href="/editorial"><span class="allow_code">don't</span> want</a> articles with computer code in them.
