Welcome to Walden Pond. There's a bunch of things to explore in the menu, up there ‚Üó.

If there isn't much in your Pocket yet, take a look in your emails for some places that might have something you'll want to read and some tips on how to make saving things easier.

I'd love to hear about how this is all going for you! Give me suggestions and I'll do my best to make them happen.
