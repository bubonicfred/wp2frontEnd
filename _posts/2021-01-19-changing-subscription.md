It's pretty easy to change how long your edition of Walden Pond is. You can even pause your subscription.

Everyone's circumstances change, usually pretty frequently. So if you know you've got a bit of cabin time coming up, and you want a longer edition, or you're about to go into intense crunch time, and want a shorter edition, or even to pause for a while, you can go to the <em>payment details</em> page and change your edition length, or pause your subscription.
