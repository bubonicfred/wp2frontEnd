I've done a <a href="https://waldenpond.press/2021/02/17/popularity_feb.html">couple</a> of <a href="https://waldenpond.press/2020/08/30/popularity.html">these</a> so far, and they're always super interesting. This post is really long, so you can jump about with these links, and you absolutely shouldn't read it from top to bottom like a book!

<h1 id="graphs">Some Graphs</h1>

### Lengths

It makes sense that there are more short articles than long because you can fit more shorties into a given length book, but the interesting thing is that the peak is shifted to the right over the default of people's overall Pocket which seems to be at about 2&ndash;3 minutes, this peak is over 6ish minutes.

### Authors

Ben Thompson gets the top slot here down to one person who has been using WP as a way to get books of the Stratechery subscription content (which is an awesome use case), but it's cool to see Venkatesh up there, given that I pinched his idea for the name of the product.

Names like SUBMISSION and EMAIL are sad because it's bad metadata from the publishers, so we'll never know who the real author is. (e.g. EMAIL is almost entirely the [Marc Andreessen](https://www.theobservereffect.org/marc.html) interview. I read it last night, it's good.)

There's a [mega list of authors](#lots-of-authors) at the bottom of this page, most of them have links to their author page if you want to check them out.

### Sources

There's a really noticeable break between the major publishers and the niche publishers (bad names, but they'll do). The niche section probably says something about the kind of people who read WP, but it's also worth remembering that those bars are all <100, and there have been something like ten thousand (9971) articles printed so far. Half (4379) of them come from the top 37 publishers. (The ones shown in the graph.) The rest (5592) come from 2433 other places!

Pocket is in the top ten twice because of a really infuriating thing where they recommend an article, but then colonise its metadata. I think everyone would prefer they didn't do that.

### Tags

Nbody has really gone hard with using tags to make custom editions yet (as far as I can tell), but people love the <code>wpMustPrint</code> and <code>wpNoPrint</code> tags.

This is an all time chart, I've been thinking about doing a month by month leaderboard at some point.
