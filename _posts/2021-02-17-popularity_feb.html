    >August I posted a list of articles that have been printed in a WP</a

  been saved. This list has everything that's been printed for more than one
  person (which gets around the privacy issue quite nicely too).

      In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his groundbreaking book, The
      Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, which described
      his three laws of motion. In the process, Newton laid the foundation for
      classical mechanics and redefined the way the world looked at physics and
      science.

      IT’S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to
      great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the
      wrong person. Partly, it’s because we have a bewildering array of problems
      that emerge when we try to get close to others.

      the observations that would eventually form the basis of “On the Origin of

      Instead, we think of technology as being used to express media, rather

    <p class="exerpt">
      Most of us have a pretty terrible understanding of history. Our knowledge
      is spotty, with large gaps all over the place, and the parts of history we
      do end up knowing a lot about usually depend on the particular teachers,
      parents, books, articles, and movies we happen to come across in our
      lives.

      We worship efficiency. Use less to get more. Same-day delivery. Multitask;
      text on one device while emailing on a second, and perhaps conversing on a
      third. Efficiency is seen as good. Inefficiency as wasteful. There’s a
      sound rationale for thinking this way.
