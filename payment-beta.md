Currently there isn't a button to automatically cancel your subscription, which is a total dick move, but this link will send an email to me, and I'll do it for you: [cancel my subscription](mailto:ben@notionparallax.co.uk?cc=user@email.com&subject=Cancel my Walden Pond subscription please&body=No hard feelings)
